Collection of COBOL projects developed as part of my preparation to work in the mainframe and legacy systems sector, particularly in the banking and financial industry.

## About This Repository

This folder contains COBOL projects that demonstrate my ability to work with legacy technologies widely used in enterprise environments. Each project focuses on different aspects of business logic and mainframe programming.

**Purpose:** To showcase my self-learning capability, understanding of COBOL fundamentals, and readiness to work with legacy banking systems.

## Projects

### 1. [Banking Management System](sistema-bancario-cobol/)

## Learning Journey

### Why COBOL?

Despite being perceived as "legacy," COBOL remains crucial in the financial sector:

- **60% of global transactions** still run on COBOL systems
- **Banking sector** heavily relies on mainframe technology
- **Job stability** in an area with talent shortage
- **Critical systems** that cannot be easily migrated

### Skills Demonstrated

Through these projects, I demonstrate:

- **Autonomous learning** - Self-taught COBOL from scratch
- **Business logic understanding** - Implementation of financial validations
- **Legacy systems appreciation** - Recognition of their importance in enterprise
- **Problem-solving** - Creating functional solutions with constraints
- **Documentation skills** - Clear, bilingual technical documentation

## Future Projects (Roadmap)

- [ ] **Employee Payroll System** - Calculate salaries, taxes, and deductions
- [ ] **Inventory Management** - Stock control with ISAM file handling
- [ ] **Report Generator** - Using COBOL ReportWriter module
- [ ] **Data File Processing** - Sequential and indexed file operations
- [ ] **Simple Accounting System** - Ledger management with transactions

## Professional Context

These projects were developed as preparation for opportunities in:

- Mainframe programming positions
- Banking and financial sector roles
- Legacy system maintenance and modernization
- COBOL developer positions

**Target Role:** COBOL/Mainframe Programmer in the banking sector

- **macOS:** `brew install gnucobol`

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/3stefani/cobol.git
cd cobol

# Navigate to a project
cd sistema-bancario-cobol

# Compile
cobc -x -free banco-simple.cob

# Run
./banco-simple  # Linux/macOS
banco-simple.exe  # Windows
```

## About Me

**Estefan√≠a Ram√≠rez Mart√≠nez**

**‚ú® Education:** Higher Level Training Cycle in Application Development  
**‚ú® Career Goal:** Mainframe/COBOL Developer in Banking Sector  
**‚ú® Interests:** Legacy systems, financial technology, mainframe programming  
**‚ú® Currently Learning:** COBOL, JCL, DB2, CICS

### Why I'm Learning COBOL

While many developers focus on modern technologies, I recognized an opportunity in the significant demand for COBOL developers in the banking sector. The combination of:

- High demand for COBOL programmers
- Stable career path in financial institutions
- Critical systems requiring maintenance
- Opportunity to work on large-scale enterprise systems

motivated me to invest time in mastering this technology.
