Console application developed in COBOL that simulates basic banking operations. Project created as part of my preparation to work in the mainframe sector and legacy technologies.

## Project Overview

Simplified banking system that allows managing a checking account with fundamental operations: balance inquiries, deposits, and withdrawals. Includes business validations to ensure transaction integrity.

**‚ú® Context:** This project was developed as preparation for a COBOL/Mainframe programming job opportunity, demonstrating autonomous learning capacity and familiarization with legacy technologies widely used in the banking sector.

## Features

| Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Balance inquiry** | View current account balance |
| **Cash deposit** | Add funds with positive amount validation |
| **Cash withdrawal** | Extract funds with insufficient balance control |
| **Validations** | Control of negative amounts and balance availability |
| **Interactive interface** | Console menu with options |

## Demo

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** COBOL (free format)
- **Standard:** COBOL-85
- **Compiler:** GnuCOBOL 3.2
- **Development environment:** Visual Studio Code
- **Operating system:** Windows 10

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project you need:

- GnuCOBOL 3.2 or higher
  - **Windows:** [Download from Arnold Trembley](https://www.arnoldtrembley.com/GnuCOBOL.htm)
  - **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install gnucobol`
  - **macOS:** `brew install gnucobol`

## Installation and Usage

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sistema-bancario-cobol.git
cd sistema-bancario-cobol
```

### Compile the program

```bash
cobc -x -free banco-simple.cob
```

### Run

**Windows:**
```cmd
banco-simple.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./banco-simple
```

## Testing

The program has been tested with the following cases:

- Initial balance inquiry
- Deposit of valid amounts (positive)
- Withdrawal within available balance

## COBOL Concepts Implemented

### Program Divisions
- **IDENTIFICATION DIVISION:** Program metadata
- **ENVIRONMENT DIVISION:** Environment configuration
- **DATA DIVISION:** Data structure definition
- **PROCEDURE DIVISION:** Program logic

### Data Types
```cobol
PIC 9(10)      - 10-digit integers
PIC 9(7)V99    - Decimal numbers (7 integers + 2 decimals)
PIC X(30)      - 30-character alphanumeric strings
```

### Control Flow
- `PERFORM`: Procedure calls
- `EVALUATE`: Multiple decision structure (similar to switch/case)
- `IF-ELSE`: Conditionals
- `UNTIL`: Loops with condition

### Arithmetic Operations
- `ADD ... TO`: Accumulative addition
- `SUBTRACT ... FROM`: Subtraction
- `MOVE`: Value assignment

## Professional Application

This project demonstrates:

1. **Learning ability:** Learned COBOL autonomously for this application
2. **Banking business logic understanding:** Implementation of financial validations
3. **Maintainable code:** Clear structure with well-defined procedures
4. **Mainframe preparation:** Familiarization with financial sector legacy technologies
